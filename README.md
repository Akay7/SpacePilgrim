# Rice Rocks

You control a little spaceship that is opposed to the cosmic asteroids.

## Idea

This game is remake of the final project of [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2) course on Coursera from Rice Univercity.


## How to start play

You have two choices:

- Download beta version in [Play Market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pro.crazyrussian.ricerockskivy) for your Android device.

- You can start it from source code for this you need installing python and Kivy. [Here](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html#install-win-dist) instructions for Windows users.

- I'm also planing share binary file for MS Windows systems, but it not ready yet.


## ToDo

1. Update game for two players on one device.
2. Draw normal joystick on screen instead buttons.
3. Add settings for key mapping and etc.
4. Allow multiplayer game on multiple devices.
